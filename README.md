# SeaLion

The project SeaLion is a C++ implementation of a RTSG (<i>Real Time Strategy Game</i>) naval battles using the SFML library (see SFML repository: https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git).

## Gameplay and Functionalities

### Basics
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
SeaLion starts with a random generated map and two fleets, each of wich can be Italian, American, English or Japanese. The objective is to destroy all the enemy 
ships using the weaponry at your dose, in particular: battleships, crusaders, destroyers, aircraft carriers and submarines. You can select a ship just clicking on it, and then move it selecting the destination point, 
but be aware of the obstacles spread on the map.
